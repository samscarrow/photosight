# Appendix: Conceptual Examples

These theoretical examples illustrate the types of photos YOLO enhancement saves:

## Categories

### 1. **Artistic Bokeh** (`artistic_bokeh/`)
Professional portraits with shallow depth of field where the subject is sharp but background is intentionally soft.

### 2. **Group Photos with Depth** (`group_depth/`)  
Wedding and event photos where different rows of people are at different focal distances.

### 3. **Environmental Portraits** (`environmental/`)
Street photography where the subject is sharp against a motion-blurred or soft background.

### 4. **Action Context** (`action_context/`)
Sports or activity photos where the main subject is sharp but surroundings show motion.

### 5. **Pet Photography** (`pet_focus/`)
Pet portraits with soft, dreamy backgrounds focusing attention on the animal.

These examples represent common photography scenarios where traditional blur detection fails but YOLO's subject-aware analysis correctly preserves artistic intent.
